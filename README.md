# Hearing-Well-Being-Survey-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning

Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze a survey dataset related to hearing well-being and build machine learning models to predict whether a person is interested in a hearing app (Interest_in_Hearing_App).

Step 1: Data Preprocessing


•	Loading data: The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame called df.
•	Handling missing values:
o	Rows or columns with all missing values are dropped (df.dropna(axis=1, how="all")).
o	Missing values are then filled using a SimpleImputer with the most frequent value strategy. This replaces missing data points with the most common value in the respective columns.
•	The goal is to ensure no missing values remain for the model training stage.

Step 2: Define Features and Target


•	The target variable for prediction is "Interest_in_Hearing_App".
•	Features (X) are all other columns excluding the target.
•	Target (y) is the "Interest_in_Hearing_App" column.

Step 3: Train-Test Split


•	The dataset is split into training and testing sets using:
•	X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
•	20% of the data is held out for testing the model after training.
•	Random state ensures reproducibility.

Step 4: Define Models


You are training six classification models:
•	Logistic Regression
•	Decision Tree Classifier
•	Random Forest Classifier
•	Naive Bayes
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Step 5: Model Training and Evaluation


•	Each model is trained (model.fit(X_train, y_train)) on the training data.
•	Predictions are made on the test data (model.predict(X_test)).
•	Accuracy is calculated using accuracy_score.
•	Accuracies are stored in a dictionary.

Step 6: Issue Observed


•	Logistic Regression raises a Convergence Warning indicating the model didn’t converge within 1000 iterations.
•	This usually means:
o	Data may need scaling (especially important for Logistic Regression, SVM).
o	Model parameters like max_iter may need to be increased.
•	The warning suggests scaling data using preprocessing techniques for better convergence.

Step 7: Results


•	Accuracies of models are quite low overall, with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes performing the best (~46-47% accuracy).
•	The other models perform worse (between 34% to 40% accuracy).
•	This indicates that the models are not very effective with the current features or data.

Step 8: Visualization


•	A bar chart is plotted showing the accuracy of each model.
•	Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes stand out slightly above the others but still under 50% accuracy.

Summary and Next Steps:


•	The project has successfully implemented a pipeline to preprocess data, split it, train multiple models, and evaluate their performance.
•	However, the model performance is low, suggesting improvements are needed.
•	Recommended improvements:
o	Scale the features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
o	Perform feature selection or engineering to find better predictors.
o	Tune hyperparameters of models for better performance.
o	Try other more advanced models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
o	Use cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
